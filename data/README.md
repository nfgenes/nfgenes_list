# NFgenes List
The source list of unique human genes will be maintained in this public repository. Anyone will have the ability to submit a pull request to make changes to the list. PR requests will be passed along to the DAO for review and approval. Once a change has been approved by the DAO, the PR will be merged and the new list will be uploaded to IPFS and the contract updated with the new URI.
